Welcome to the MoonRover project! This is a versatile rover designed for lunar exploration and data collection. 
It's powered by two hoverboard motors, equipped with a spinning blade for obstacle removal, a preflashed motherboard for efficient control, a meteorological station for environmental data, and a camera for capturing stunning lunar images.

## Features
#### 1. Hoverboard Motors
The MoonRover is powered by two hoverboard motors, providing stability and maneuverability on lunar terrain.
These motors are optimized for low-gravity environments, making it an ideal choice for moon exploration.
#### 2. Obstacle Removal Blade
A spinning blade is mounted on the front of the rover to remove small obstacles and clear a path for the rover's movement.
#### 3. Preflashed Motherboard
The rover is controlled by a preflashed motherboard, ensuring efficient and reliable operation.
The motherboard is equipped with a range of sensors and communication interfaces.
#### 4. Meteorological Station
The onboard meteorological station monitors humidity and temperatures on the lunar surface.
This data is essential for understanding lunar environmental conditions.
#### 5. Camera
A high-resolution camera is installed on the rover for capturing images and videos of the lunar landscape.
The camera can be controlled remotely to capture stunning lunar vistas.
